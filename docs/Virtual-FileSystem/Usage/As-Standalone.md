# As Standalone

!!! warning "TODO"

    This section needs to be written.

    This page should document how to use the Virtual FileSystem as a standalone injectable binary
    not tied to any modding framework.

    Topics to cover:
    
    - Loading into a program (DLL injection)
    - Outputting a mapping file for file redirections
    - Configuration options
    - Config file format
